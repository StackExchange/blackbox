# Branches and Tags:

There are 3 branches/tags:

* **HEAD:** The cutting edge of development.
* **tag stable:** Stable enough for use by most people.
* **tag production:** Burned in long enough that we are confident it can be widely adopted.

If you are packaging Blackbox for distribution, you should track the *tag production*.  You might also want to provide a separate package that tracks *tag stable:* for early adopters.

# Build Tasks

# Stable Releases

Marking the software to be "stable":

```
git pull
git tag -d stable
git push origin :stable
git tag stable
git push origin tag stable
```

# Production Releases

If no bugs have been reported a full week after a stable tag has been pushed, mark the release to be "production".

```
git fetch
git checkout stable
git tag -d production
git push origin :production
git tag production
git push origin tag production
R="v1.$(date +%Y%m%d)"
git tag "$R"
git push origin tag "$R
```
