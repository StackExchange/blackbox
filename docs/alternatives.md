Alternatives
============

Here are other open source packages that do something similar to
BlackBox. If you like them better than BlackBox, please use them.

- [git-crypt](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/)
- [Pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/)
- [Transcrypt](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt)
- [Keyringer](https://keyringer.pw/)
- [git-secret](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret)

git-crypt has the best git integration. Once set up it is nearly
transparent to the users. However it only works with git.
