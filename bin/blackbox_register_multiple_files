# blackbox_register_multiple_files -- Enroll a list of files
# 
# Wraps around blackbox_register_new_file to enable
# enrollment of multiple files.  Currently each enrollment
# is it's own commit, but should probably allow a -batch
# methodology. On deployment to systems that need the 
# plaintext (unencrypted) versions, run blackbox_postdeploy.sh 
# to decrypt all the files.
