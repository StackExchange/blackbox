# blackbox_shred_all_files -- shred all decrypted versions of encrypted files
#
# Shred: To securely delete a file.
#
# Typical uses:
#   After running blackbox_edit_start, deciding not to edit the file.
#   A developer that wants to securely clean up a workspace before deleting it.
#   An automated process that doesn't want to leave
#       plaintext (unencrypted) files laying around.
#
# NOTE: The output lists files that were decrypted and are being
# shredded.  For example, if you have many encrypted files but none
# have been decrypted for editing, you will see an empty list.
